This is the last working version with the ported revive system from the F3 framework.

Known issues with this version:

* When players die in a building they fall through the floor.
* People were reporting that revive actions weren't working? No further info at all...

Recently fixed issues:

* Dragging somebody would break all revive actions.

TODO List:

* Change loadout saving system to use CBA's loadout changed event.
* Clean up revive briefing text
